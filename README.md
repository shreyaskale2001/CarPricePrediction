# CarPricePrediction
This is based on Machine Learning model

This is a simple machine learning project which predicts the Price of car using model built with the linear Regression Algorithm. This project aims to apply various Python tools to clean the data, and various liblary to analysis.

# How this project does?
First of all the data was scraped from Quikr.com (https://quikr.com).

The data was cleaned and analysed.

Then a Linear Regression model was built on top of it which had 0.92 R2_score.

This project was given the form of an website built on Flask where we used the Linear Regression model to perform predictions.
